# GAMS-code
Code for the paper "A Mathematical Model for a Multi-Commodity, Two-Stage Transportation and Inventory Problem (IJIET)"

The data taken to solve the problem at hand is the same which has been given in the paper in 'Numerical Example' section and we see that this code indeed gives the same results  given in the 'Numerical Results' section.

The job was solved using the DICOPT solver available on neos servers.
